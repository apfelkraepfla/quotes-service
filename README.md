# Quotes-Service

## Description
The intent of this project is to become more familiar with Golang and GitHub.

The quotes service is a very simple gRPC service in Golang. For development I experiment with VS Codes devcontainers, and Tilt (with Minikube). It started as a part of the project https://github.com/apfelkraepfla/tilt-my-dev that grew over its initial purpose, and became too convoluted.
